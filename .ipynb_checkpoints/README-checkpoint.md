# Premier League Transfer Fees and Player Performance Analysis (2023/24)

## Overview
This project investigates the relationship between Premier League player transfer fees and on-field performance during the 2023/24 season.  
It explores whether higher financial investments are associated with better individual productivity after transfers, using data analysis and regression techniques.
